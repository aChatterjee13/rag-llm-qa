       " 'answer': 'Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" or \"energy factories\" of the cell. They are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy-carrying molecule in cells. This process, known as cellular respiration, involves the breakdown of glucose to generate ATP. Mitochondria are oval-shaped organelles with a double membrane structure. They have their own ribosomes and DNA, which is arranged in a circular chromosome similar to that found in bacteria.\\n\\nThe inner membrane of mitochondria contains folds called cristae, which serve to increase the surface area of the membrane. The area inside the inner membrane, known as the mitochondrial matrix, plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. Mitochondria use oxygen to release energy stored in nutrients, and this process is supported by evidence suggesting that mitochondria evolved from an endosymbiotic event with bacteria. \\n\\nFurthermore, mitochondria have the ability to divide on their own through a process resembling binary fission seen in prokaryotes. They also possess unique ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble those found in prokaryotes, further supporting their evolutionary relationship with bacteria. Overall, mitochondria are essential organelles in cells that play a critical role in energy production and cellular respiration.'}"
