The mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell as it is responsible for producing the energy for the cell. Mitochondria have an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane is folded into cristae that increases the surface area for the enzymes to produce energy. Mitochondria are able to generate energy through the process of cellular respiration.
